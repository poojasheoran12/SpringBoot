You’ve probably seen your app start and print something like this in the console:

```
Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
Started MyApplication in 2.345 seconds
```

But what *is* Tomcat, and how does Spring Boot work with it?
Let’s go from **layman → formal → takeaway** again 💡

## ☕ **Layman Explanation: What is Tomcat and How Spring Boot Uses It**

Imagine you’re running a **restaurant** 🍽️.

* Customers (users) come in and place orders (HTTP requests).
* You (the chef/Spring Boot app) cook the meal (process logic).
* But you need a **waiter** to take orders from customers and deliver the meal.

That **waiter** is Tomcat.

---

### 🧩 What is Tomcat?

**Tomcat** is a **Web Server + Servlet Container** made by Apache.

* A **web server** listens to HTTP requests (like `GET`, `POST`, etc.) on a port (usually `8080`).
* A **servlet container** runs small Java programs (servlets) that handle those requests and send back responses.

So Tomcat’s job is:

> “Listen for web requests, pass them to the right Java code (your controllers), and send back responses.”

---

### ⚙️ How Spring Boot Uses Tomcat

Before Spring Boot, developers had to:

* Manually install Tomcat.
* Package their app as a **WAR** file.
* Deploy it into Tomcat’s “webapps” folder.

😩 Too much setup!

Spring Boot changed this.

Now:

1. Spring Boot **embeds Tomcat** inside your app.

   * It’s just a Java library (`spring-boot-starter-web`) that includes Tomcat JARs.
2. When you run:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   or

   ```java
   SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
   ```

   Spring Boot:

   * Starts Tomcat *programmatically* inside your app.
   * Tells Tomcat: “Hey, run on port 8080 and listen for requests.”
3. Tomcat now becomes your **built-in waiter** 🧑‍🍳.

   * It receives incoming requests (like `GET /users`).
   * Passes them to your **Spring MVC DispatcherServlet**.
   * Which routes them to the right `@Controller` method.

So you can think of your app like this:

```
Browser → Tomcat (server) → DispatcherServlet → Your Controller → Service → Database
```

---

### 🪄 You Don’t Even See Tomcat

You don’t have to install or manage it because:

* It’s embedded.
* Spring Boot automatically configures it for you when you use:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```

That’s why you can just run your app like a normal Java program (`main()`), but it still behaves like a full-fledged web server.

---

## 🧠 **Formal Explanation**

Tomcat is an **HTTP web server and servlet container** that implements the **Java Servlet API** and **JavaServer Pages (JSP)** specification.

In Spring Boot:

* The dependency `spring-boot-starter-web` brings `spring-boot-starter-tomcat` (as the embedded servlet container).
* The **SpringApplication** initializes an **ApplicationContext** and starts an **EmbeddedWebServerApplicationContext**.
* This context creates and starts an **embedded Tomcat instance** using the `TomcatServletWebServerFactory`.
* A special servlet, called the **DispatcherServlet**, is registered with Tomcat to route HTTP requests to your controllers.

Formally:

1. Tomcat starts and listens on the configured port.
2. When a request comes in, Tomcat:

   * Creates a `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse`.
   * Passes them to Spring’s `DispatcherServlet`.
3. `DispatcherServlet` maps the request to a `@Controller` or `@RestController` based on URL patterns.
4. Controller processes it and returns a response.
5. Tomcat sends the response back to the client.

---

### 🧭 Example

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, Pooja!";
    }
}
```

Flow:

```
Browser: GET /hello
↓
Tomcat receives request on port 8080
↓
Passes to DispatcherServlet
↓
DispatcherServlet → finds HelloController
↓
HelloController.sayHello() returns "Hello, Pooja!"
↓
Tomcat sends HTTP response back to browser
```

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

* **Tomcat** = Web server + Servlet container that handles HTTP requests.
* In **Spring Boot**, Tomcat is **embedded** — no external installation needed.
* When you run your app, Spring Boot **starts Tomcat automatically**.
* **DispatcherServlet** (inside Spring MVC) acts as the traffic controller between Tomcat and your code.
* You can even replace Tomcat with **Jetty** or **Undertow** if you prefer.

The **backend code** (like your Spring Boot app) actually *runs on the server*.
When we say “the server fetches data,” what we *really* mean is:

> “The backend code running on the server fetches the data from the database.”

---

### 🔹 More concretely

Let’s say you have this:

```java
@GetMapping("/users")
public List<User> getUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
}
```

Here’s what happens:

1. 🌍 The **server (Tomcat)** receives the HTTP request:
   → `GET /users`
2. ⚙️ It passes the request to your **backend code (Spring Boot app)**.
3. 🧠 Your backend logic runs — calls the `userRepository`, fetches data from the database.
4. 💬 Backend sends the result (a list of users) back to the **server**.
5. 🚀 The **server** wraps it into an HTTP response and sends it to the **client (browser/app)**.

So, **technically**:

* The **backend** performs the logic (fetch, validate, calculate, etc.)
* The **server** is the environment that *hosts and delivers* that backend code to clients.

---

## 🧠 **Formal Explanation**

* A **server** is a *runtime environment* or *process* that accepts network connections and routes them to appropriate handlers.
* The **backend** is the *application code* that defines *what to do* when certain requests are received.
* In the case of Spring Boot:

  * Tomcat (server) handles the **HTTP layer**.
  * Spring Boot (backend) handles the **business logic** and **data access**.

You can think of it this way:

```
Server (Tomcat) = delivery mechanism
Backend (Spring Boot) = business brain
```

Together, they make a complete web application.

---

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

* The **backend** is your *application logic* — written in Spring Boot, Node.js, etc.
* The **server** is the *system that hosts and runs* that backend, managing incoming and outgoing requests.
* When we say “the server fetches data,” it’s shorthand — really, the *backend code running on the server* does that.
* Tomcat = server
* Spring Boot = backend (that runs inside Tomcat)
